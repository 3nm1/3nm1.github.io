# Hello

## A bit about me
I have since childhood, had a great interest for technology, and trying to wrap my head around how things work (to my sisters dismay, since it sometimes mean't I disassembled their toys, to see what made them tick) 

My dad started his own truck driving company before I was born, and to keep costs down he started doing maintenance himself. This of course meant that young me had access to a great set of many different tools, and started to learn how to use them both supervised an unsupervised (my dad did'nt want to teach 7-year old me how the acetylen torch worked, but that defenetly was knowledge i wanted.) I early own grew to like the electrical dicipline more than the mechanical side of cars and trucks and i was the only kid in the neighbourhood with a soap box car that had working blinkers, hazard lights and a stereo.

In higschool I choose to study electronics, and learnt much about components, electronics repair and programming.

After highschool I did my military service as an communications officer in the army.

And then it was time to try to find what I wanted to be as A grownup.

I went to college and studied computer science focusing on network administration and system technology.

During my time in Collage i also upgraded my drivers license so i was allowed to drive trucks. and started helping out in my dads company in my spare time.

After college I had a hard time trying to get hired and be able to use my new skills from college, which mean't i continued to drive trucks for my dad.

After a couple of years I choose to get back behind the school desk, and study Automation. 

After graduating I got hired by one of the companies that I had been visiting during my education. They specialized in building machines catered to the customers demand, and I got involed with both drawing schematics and programming.

After two years the company sadly had to let some people go, and that meant I had to start searching for a new job.

I ended up in the consulting business, where I was able to expand my expertise, and get involved in bigger projects then earlier, and that is roughly where I am at now.
